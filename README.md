# Fourier_audio
Audio treatment through Fourier analysis

The MATLAB code first presents the Fourier analysis of a square wave. Then, the frequencies of two audio signals are filtered using high-pass and low-pass filters.
All done using only lines of code.

Developed in class at FEI University Center with Professor Vanderlei.
